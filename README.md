Property Price Prediction using Linear Regression

📦 Project Overview

Property Price Prediction using Linear Regression leverages historical property data to predict real estate prices based on various factors such as location, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities. The model is developed using Python and Scikit-Learn to provide accurate price estimates, assisting buyers, sellers, and investors in making data-driven decisions.

✅ Features

* Predict property prices using linear regression.
* Analyze the impact of different property attributes on pricing.
* Data visualization for better insights.
* Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R² score.
